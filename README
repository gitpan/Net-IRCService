Net/IRCService version 0.02
============================


Net::IRCService is suposed to be a easy interface to create more or
less usefull IRC-Services. If you have worked with Net::IRC before, 
you will fast get to grip on how this module works. It has -almost- the
same event-driven interface. It lets you add one or more event handlers
to EVENTS seen by the module. 

This module is first of all made for personal use, but it would be fun
to see if anyone else would get any fun out of this module. But, be aware,
this is the first and initial release, and its not tested too much.
Im sure there are some bugs yet to be found, so please dont put it right
in to a production network without testing it first.

This module was devloped out from my experience from hybrid6/7 and
bahamut, and is know to work (atlast connect to, and stay connected when
idle) with following versions:

	o ircd-hybrid-6.3.1
	o ircd-hybrid-7rc8
	o bahamut-1.4.33

BUGS

If you find any bugs, please send a mail to me about it. If you know how 
to fix it, send me a patch.
