Net/IRCService version 0.12
============================


Net::IRCService is suposed to be a easy interface to create more or
less usefull IRC-Services. If you have worked with Net::IRC before, 
you will fast get to grip on how this module works. It has -almost- the
same event-driven interface. It lets you add one or more event handlers
to EVENTS seen by the module. 

This module is first of all made for personal use, but it would be fun
to see if anyone else would get any fun out of this module. But, be aware,
this is the first and initial release, and its not tested too much.
Im sure there are some bugs yet to be found, so please dont put it right
in to a production network without testing it first.

This module was devloped out from my experience from hybrid6/7 and
bahamut, and is know to work (atleast connect to, and stay connected when
idle) with following versions:

	o <= ircd-hybrid-6.4 
	o ircd-hybrid-7rc8
	o bahamut-1.4.33	

(Im only testing on hybrid6.4 at the moment. No more bahamut support will
come from me, since Im not a Criten staffmember anymore. (Maybe a DALnet
server needs a new staffmember? :P j/k))

INSTALL

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

	o POSIX
	o IO::Select
	o IO::Socket
	o Socket
	o Fcntl
	o Carp
		(All found in the standard perl suit)

BUGS

If you find any bugs, please use RT to report it. If you know how 
to fix it, send me a patch.

If you want to add support for any other ircd, please do so. I dont think
I will add any other protocols unless -I- need it. (Nextthing to do here
is to add support for ircd-ratbox, a hybrid-clone. http://www.ircd-ratbox.org
