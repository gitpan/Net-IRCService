 o Bug-reports from; Jonas Liljegren

 o Big, warm, and not-to-gay hug to all IRCD-coders out there. I dig your works :)

 o Thanks to Hybnet, for shaping my irc-intrests. I dont think I would do any of
   this work if they wasnt kind enough to let me admin some servers over there.

 o Hi to all you irc.avalonworks.ca(EFNet) users/opers out there, I love you guys!

 o Underworld is my playground. Im talking about the norwegian organization
   located at www.underworld.no, and #underworld at EFNet. 

 o I can't understand that my girlfriend accepts all my coding. She is my
   solemate, and best frind. 

My top-2 IRCD list; 

1. ircd-hybrid 6.* (cur. v6.4) The -real- IRCD. :)
1. ircd-ratbox * The semi-real IRCD with LOTS of nice features.
2. ircd-hybrid 7.* The up-to-now-bloadet IRCD. :P

I will become a ircd-coder when I learn C. (Like, never :P)
